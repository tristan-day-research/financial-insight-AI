# Financial Planning RAG System with Multi-Tenent Knowledge Base 

A comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that transforms unstructured financial documents into an intelligent knowledge base for automated financial planning, reporting, and forecasting.
üéØ Problem Statement
Financial planning companies face significant challenges in managing client data:

Manual Data Entry: Clients manually input information that often conflicts with existing documents
Document Fragmentation: Critical financial data scattered across multiple unstructured documents
Outdated Information: Business plans and forecasts rely on stale data due to manual update processes
Time-Intensive Reviews: Tedious manual document review and reconciliation processes

### Multi-Tenant Knowledge Base Architecture

**üåü KEY INNOVATION: Collective Intelligence System**

The system implements a sophisticated multi-tenant architecture that leverages the **collective wisdom of all client data** while maintaining strict privacy boundaries. This creates a powerful network effect where each client benefits from insights derived from the entire ecosystem.

**Individual Client KBs (Private Layer)**
- Isolated data silos ensuring complete privacy and compliance
- Client-specific document processing and entity extraction
- Personalized financial insights and recommendations
- Dedicated vector spaces and SQL schemas per client

**Global Aggregate KB (Intelligence Layer)**
- **Anonymized Cross-Client Learning**: Patterns and insights extracted from all clients without exposing individual data
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Real-time comparative analysis against similar businesses
- **Predictive Model Enhancement**: Machine learning models trained on aggregate data improve individual client forecasts
- **Market Intelligence**: Collective insights into industry trends, seasonal patterns, and economic indicators

**Multi-Tenant Benefits:**
- **Enhanced Forecasting Accuracy**: Models trained on thousands of businesses outperform single-client models
- **Industry-Specific Insights**: Automatic categorization and comparison with similar business types
- **Risk Assessment**: Collective patterns help identify financial risks and opportunities
- **Benchmarking Intelligence**: "How does my business compare to similar companies?"
- **Predictive Analytics**: Early warning systems based on patterns observed across the client base

## üöÄ Features
