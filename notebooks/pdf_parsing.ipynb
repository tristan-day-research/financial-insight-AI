Dr Philippa Bryce resigned asa trustee on 26 June 2017 and was therefore a trustee throughout the period of this report. Since the year endthere have been no additions to the board oftrustees. At the Annual General Meeting Dr Carol Cooper, Prof Andrew Sherman, Prof James Walker and Janet Brayretired as trustees, but are eligible for reappointment. All the trustees are also members ofthe charity. Objects and activities ofthe charity\\nThe purposes ofthe charity as set out in its governing document:\\n~ To educate, inform and advise the public and health professionals about the prevalence, nature andrisks ofpre- eclampsia and eclampsia;\\n~ To campaign for greater public awareness ofthe disease and for action to improve methods ofdetectionand treatment; and\\n~ To promote the relief ofpersons who suffer Pre-eclampsia and to relieve the stress offamilies ofsuchpersons. The main activities undertaken in relation to those purposes during the year.\\n~ During the year we undertook a number ofstudy days for midwives and student midwives. We provided afree e- learning package to increase the number ofpeople reached and raised awareness through oursocial media channels.\\n~ We ran a highly successful Experts Day to share knowledge and experience. This was attended by arecord number ofsenior clinicians and we gratefully acknowledge the support ofA1M Pharma withoutwhom this event would not have taken place. This was an opportunity for many ofthe leading thinkers tocome together and discuss progress on research in pre-eclampsia. We are very grateful for the number ofspeakers who freely gave their time to this important event which we anticipate will grow over the years tocome.\\n~ We offered support to families affected by Pre-eclampsia through our helpline, email and social mediapresence. We offer verbal support, a listening ear, contact with others who have been through similarexperiences and immediate referral to experts where needed. This has been especially important whenmothers to be have been concerned about symptoms they may be getting. On a number ofoccasionswomen have telephoned and afterwards have felt empowered to move forward with their treatment. Therehave been repeated examples throughout the year when we have been able to refer women who havehad problems in the past to experts in the field who have been able to advise them.\\n~ We continue to offer support to researchers and trials ensuring that the views ofwomen and families areheard at every level. This year has seen an escalation in the number oftrials that we are supporting. In the\\nUnited Kingdom it is often the case that ifyou wish to apply for research funding the voice ofthe patienthas to be heard and we have collaborated as coinvestigator on a number oftrials as well as providinginformal and formal advice to others. The main activities undertaken during the year to further the charity's purpose for the public benefit. The main activities ofthe charity have been to run the helpline, provide study days and to influence policy on pre- eclampsia where appropriate.

      "{'content': 'ACTION ON PRE-ECLAMPSIA LIMITED\\n(A company limited by guarantee)\\nTRUSTEES\\' REPORT (continued)\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016\\nThe trustees have had regard to the Charity Commission\\'s guidance on public benefit in managing the activitiesofthe charity. The charity\\'s strategies for achieving its aims and objectives in the future\\nThe main achievements and performance ofthe charity during the year\\n2016was a challenging year for the charity, unfortunately we lost a number of members of staff in key positionsand reduced the number of staff in the charity. Due to this inconsistency, we recorded a loss for the year. Thecharity has remained absolutely core to its objectives and has supported innumerable women and families andwent into 2017 in a far stronger position.\\nDuring the year, trustees reviewed the strategy ofthe organisation andin 2017 will begin to implement quite a number ofthe core activities which we have identified as being important. During the year, the MBRRACE report was published which showed that now in the United Kingdom fewer thanone in 1 million pregnancies end with the death of the mother from pre-eclampsia. This is down to the soundcare that is offered by the National Health Service and clearly demonstrates that with careful observation, wiseintervention and good treatment, the death of a mother can be and almost never occurrence. This is somethingthat the charity has worked towards for over 20 years and although we can only take credit for a very small partofit, it is something that we are very proud of. In June we arranged National Pre-eclampsia Day, which was an opportunity to raise awareness of the charityand the condition. We were able to take part in a number ofinterviews in the media and raise awareness throughour social media channels where we were able to hit over 1 million Twitter timelines throughout the day. We were able to take part in Baby Loss Awareness Week, the two highlights of which were the opportunity todiscuss pre-eclampsia with the Secretary of State for health and the debate in the House of Commons aboutbaby loss which was the first time that Action on Pre-Eclampsia has been mentioned in the House ofCommons. As a result of this we were able to establish relationships with a number of parliamentarians which are ongoingand helpful. During the latter half ofthe year we were asked to be involved in the preparation ofthe MBRRACE report whichfocused strongly on maternal death from pre-eclampsia. We were one ofthe organisations that co-authored thelay summary.\\nFundraising activities during the year\\nAPEC\\'s principal fundraising activity was the London Marathon where a large number of individuals once againran for the charity. We are immensely grateful to those runners who made a massive contribution. We have been fortunate to be supported this year by The Roger 8 Douglas Turner Charitable Trust, The James\\nTudor Foundation, The Follett Trust, The Sovereign Health Care Charitable Trust, The Hospital Saturday Fundand the Dumbreck Charity. We are enormously grateful for their generous philanthropy. Our members have been generous in their support which is so gratefully received. We continue to rely onvoluntary donations for virtually all our income. The difference the charity\\'s performance during the year has made to the beneficiaries ofthe charity.\\nDuring the year we have received some very positive feedback from those who have been in contact with ourhelpline. A number ofexamples ofthis are shown below:\\n\"I am grateful for the support I had from APEC from peopl \"e on the APEC Facebook group, right from thebeginning of my TTC (trying to conceive) journey to now.

Thetrustees also consider the charity to be solvent and financially sound as at 31 December 2016. The principalsources offunding for the charity come from fundraising, training courses and donations. The principal risks anduncertainties relate to certainty of funding, trustees monitor and review this and other operational/strategic risks. The trustees are fully aware that this is a year when we have made a loss and comprehensive steps have beentaken to reduce that in 2017.These steps have included a reduction in staff numbers and hours. Changes havebeen made to the way the charity manages internal accounting processes which offers far greater control ofday- to-day expenditure. Policies on reserves\\nIn the Trustees' view, the reserves should provide the charity with adequate financial stability and the means forit to meet its charitable objectives for the foreseeable future. The trustees propose to maintain the charity's reserves at a level which is at least equivalent to six monthsoperational expenditure and have done so having regards to its manner ofoperation oflikely funding streams. The trustees review the amount of reserves that are required to ensure that they are adequate to fulfil thecharity's continuing obligations on a quarterly basis at their trustee meeting. Trustees are content that reserves are at a satisfactory level given the size, scope and risks to the charity at thecurrent time. The trustees plan that the charity is a going concern and have no uncertainties other than managedrisks about this. Availability and adequacy ofassets ofeach ofthe funds\\nThe board of trustees is satisfied that the charity's assets in each fund are available and adequate to fulfil itsobligations in respect ofeach fund. Plans for the Future\\nTowards the end of 2016 plans were put in place for 2017 which broadens the scope of the activities of thecharity, in particular we will ensure that our fundraising through the marathon is more professional than everbefore and that we will streamline our study days to ensure that we work in partnership with primary care truststo deliver bespoke programmes.

Accounting Policies (continued)\\n1.5 Income\\nAll income is recognised once the charity has entitlement to the income, it is probable that theincome will be received and the amount ofincome receivable can be measured reliably. For legacies, entitlement is taken as the earlier ofthe date on which either: the charity is aware thatprobate has been granted, the estate has been finalised and notification has been made by theexecutor(s) to the Trust that a distribution will be made, or when a distribution is received from theestate. Receipt ofa legacy, in whole or in part, is only considered probable when the amount can bemeasured reliably and the charity has been notified ofthe executor's intention to make a distribution. Where legacies have been notified to the charity, or the charity is aware of the granting of probate, and the criteria for income recognition have not been met, then the legacy is treated as a contingentasset and disclosed ifmaterial. Donated services or facilities are recognised when the charity has control over the item, anyconditions associated with the donated item have been met, the receipt ofeconomic benefit from theuse of the charity of the item is probable and that economic benefit can be measured reliably. Inaccordance with the Charities SORP (FRS 102), the general volunteer time of the Friends is notrecognised and refer to the Trustees' report for more information about their contribution. On receipt, donated professional services and donated facilities are recognised on the basis of thevalue of the gift to the charity which is the amount the charity would have been willing to pay toobtain services or facilities of equivalent economic benefit on the open market; a correspondingamount is then recognised in expenditure in the period of receipt. Income tax recoverable in relation to donations received under Gift Aid or deeds of covenant isrecognised at the time ofthe donation. Income tax recoverable in relation to investment income is recognised at the time the investmentincome is receivable.

Expenditure is classified byactivity. The costs of each activity are made up of the total of direct costs and shared costs, including support costs involved in undertaking each activity. Direct costs attributable to a singleactivity are allocated directly to that activity. Shared costs which contribute to more than one activityand support costs which are not attributable to a single activity are apportioned between thoseactivities on a basis consistent with the use of resources. Central staff costs are allocated on thebasis oftime spent, and depreciation charges allocated on the portion ofthe asset's use. Support costs are those costs incurred directly in support ofexpenditure on the objects ofthe charityand include project management carried out at Headquarters. Governance costs are those incurredin connection with administration of the charity and compliance with constitutional and statutoryrequirements. Costs of generating funds are costs incurred in attracting voluntary income, and those incurred intrading activities that raise funds.\\nCharitable activities and Governance costs are costs incurred on the charity's educationaloperations, including support costs and costs relating to the governance ofthe charity apportioned tocharitable activities.\\n1.7 Turnover\", 'metadata': {'section': 'financial_statements', 'entities': {}, 'document_type': 'charity_report', 'page_number': 17, 'chunk_type': 'text'}, 'embedding': None}\n",
